1. Focus Farm
Fucus Farm is a user-friendly task planner that adds fun and motivation to efficient task management.
It contains many features that work together to create a fully functional task management tool:
  - create tasks with titles, descriptions, colors and durations;
  - set different priority levels and due dates and sort the tasks according to them;
  - edit view and delete existing tasks;
  - mark tasks as done or not done and filter them according to it.
The app also has a feature that serves as a reward system to encourage the users to finish the tasks they assigned themselves.
By finishing these tasks, virtual animals will spawn in the application's background.
This feature returns the user positive feedback when tasks are completed.

To make the Application more visually engaging, we chose to use the PyQt5 and Pygame libraries.

2. How to Install and Run
