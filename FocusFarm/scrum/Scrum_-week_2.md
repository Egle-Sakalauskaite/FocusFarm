- **Product Owner:** Alexandru Bobe
- **Development Team:** Egle Sakalauskaite, Manuel Fernández Gutiérrez, Mike Smalbroek, Ole van der Mast, Maud Remmerswaal

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Goal

- Start coding and perform first tests
- Start overleaf report

### User Stories

- Adding, editing and removing tasks
- Viewing tasks

### Sprint Backlog

**- Adding, editing and removing tasks**
- Creating Task class. Task should have a title, description, estimated duration, priority level, color code, due date, date added, status (not started, working on it or finished)
- Creating database class. The task should be saved in a database, which is stored locally on the user’s pc. Create an SQlite database for this.
- Basic user interactions (console). Editing one or more of the task properties using the console (for now) and saving the changes to the database
- Removing a task from the list

**- Viewing tasks**
- See all the completed and not yet completed tasks separately -> print in a console window
To be able to view due tasks sorted according to the priority level, due date, color-code, etc. -> in a console window

**- Testing**
- Rigorous testing of the Task class. Making sure types of user inputs match database types. 
- testing scalability of the database
- testing the user interactions in the console.
